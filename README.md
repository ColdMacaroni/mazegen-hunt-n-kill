# mazegen-hunt-n-kill
Generates a maze with the hunt and kill algorithm

## How to run
first arg is "XxY", second arg is the pixel size per cell  
e.g. `py game.py 30x20 10` will generate a maze of 30 by 20 cells, each 10 px.

If you want each cell and each wall to be one pixel, set the size as 2.  
`py game.py 40x40 2`

# mazegen-hunt-n-kill
Generates a maze with the hunt and kill algorithm

## How to run
### hunt_and_kill.py
This generates an ascii maze and you can import it to obtain the maze data through bitmasks.

To run: `py hunt_and_kill.py width height`  
e.g., `py hunt_and_kill.py 20 10` will print out a 20 by 10 cell maze.  

### maze.py
This one generates an actual image using maze data in form of bitmasks. You should be able to give it any maze bitshift data generated by any algorithm.

First arg is "WIDTHxHEIGHT", second arg is the pixel size per cell  
e.g. `py maze.py 30x20 10` will generate a maze of 30 by 20 cells, each 10 px.

If you want each cell and each wall to be one pixel, set the size as 2.  
`py maze.py 40x40 2`
